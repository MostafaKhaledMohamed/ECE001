            <dd>A programming language is a formal language comprising a set of instructions that produce various kinds of output. Programming languages are used in computer programming to implement algorithms.

                Most programming languages consist of instructions for computers. There are programmable machines that use a set of specific instructions, rather than general programming languages. Early ones preceded the invention of the digital computer, the first probably being the automatic flute player described in the 9th century by the brothers Musa in Baghdad, during the Islamic Golden Age.[1] Since the early 1800s, programs have been used to direct the behavior of machines such as Jacquard looms, music boxes and player pianos.[2] The programs for these machines (such as a player piano's scrolls) did not produce different behavior in response to different inputs or conditions.
                
                Thousands of different programming languages have been created, and more are being created every year. Many programming languages are written in an imperative form (i.e., as a sequence of operations to perform) while other languages use the declarative form (i.e. the desired result is specified, not how to achieve it).
                
                The description of a programming language is usually split into the two components of syntax (form) and semantics (meaning). Some languages are defined by a specification document (for example, the C programming language is specified by an ISO Standard) while other languages (such as Perl) have a dominant implementation that is treated as a reference. Some languages have both, with the basic language defined by a standard and extensions taken from the dominant implementation being common. </dd>

            <li><b>Machine and assembly languages</b><br><pr>A machine language consists of the numeric codes for the operations that a particular computer can execute directly. The codes are strings of 0s and 1s, or binary digits (“bits”), which are frequently converted both from and to hexadecimal (base 16) for human viewing and modification. Machine language instructions typically use some bits to represent operations, such as addition, and some to represent operands, or perhaps the location of the next instruction. Machine language is difficult to read and write, since it does not resemble conventional mathematical notation or human language, and its codes vary from computer to computer.
                Assembly language is one level above machine language. It uses short mnemonic codes for instructions and allows the programmer to introduce names for blocks of memory that hold data. One might thus write “add pay, total” instead of “0110101100101000” for an instruction that adds two numbers.

                Assembly language is designed to be easily translated into machine language. Although blocks of data may be referred to by name instead of by their machine addresses, assembly language does not provide more sophisticated means of organizing complex information. Like machine language, assembly language requires detailed knowledge of internal computer architecture. It is useful when such details are important, as in programming a computer to interact with input/output devices (printers, scanners, storage devices, and so forth).</pr></li>
            <li><b>C++ Language</b><br><pr>The C++ language has an object oriented structure which is used in large projects. Programmers can collaborate one program into different parts or even one individual work on each part of the program. The structure of object oriented also permit code to be reused many times.This language is an efficient language. But, many programmers will disagree</pr></li>
            <li><b>C Language</b><br><pr>The C language is a  basic programming language and it is a very popular language, particularly used in game programming, Because C language includes the additional packing of the C++, Every programmer uses this language because it makes programs faster . However the value of this language gives the reusability of C++ to get the slight increase in performance with C language</pr></li>
            <li><b>Java Language</b><br><pr>The Java language is a multi platform language that’s particularly helpful in networking. Of course, mostly this language is used on the web with Java applets. However, this language is used to design cross platform programs, Since it similar to C++ in structure and syntax. For C++ programmers, Java language is very easy to learn and it offers some advantages provided by object oriented  programming. Like reusability and it can be difficult to write efficient code in Java. But, nowadays the speed of the Java language has increased and 1.5 version offers some good features for easy program making.</pr></li>
            <li><b>Python</b><br><pr>Python has grown considerably in popularity in recent years, especially for creating websites and even mobile apps. Python is relatively easy to become proficient in, making it attractive to new programmers</pr></li>
            <li><b>C#</b><br><pr>if you want to focus on the Windows smartphone app market, C# takes the lead where iOS utilizes Objective-C.</pr></li>

	<h1 style="color:#117c8a;text-align:center;padding:10px">Importance of programming</h1>
	<p style="padding:20px;font-size:20px;line-height:30px">Modern human life is greatly influenced by computers. And the computer is run by a computer program. Computer programs are arranged by programming languages, therefore they are the basis of all the conveniences that we feel. Programming languages are responsible for all programs that have been made; rostering systems, virtual reality, scheduling software, online games, Uber app, anti-virus and so on. Thus mastering programming languages brings one closer to understanding how all digital technology originates. This article will highlight the importance of programming languages.

Programming languages ​​refer to different types of expressions and logical structuring rules that serve to generate recurring and systematic tasks. They are of great importance because they allow generating different systems that serve tasks that meet the needs of users. There is a great variety of these languages ​​and in any case they are oriented to different types of requirements; however, this plurality can be divided into two large groups, structured programming languages ​​and object-oriented languages. Almost everything we can use in computer science is largely due to programming languages.

A computer allows calculation operations at high speed; However, it is totally unusable if it were not for the programs that run on it. These programs are of various kinds, with the operating system perhaps the most important of all, the system on which the different applications run. Programming languages ​​are always necessary for their development, each of which has specific characteristics for its implementation. In addition, each programming language is written in turn with a lower level, allowing a plurality of responses to existing needs. In other words, each program is made in a clear flow; simple solutions are followed by more complex solutions, and so on, following the path that is adapted to the evolving needs. It is worth remembering that every discipline comes from a simple understanding, so does the science of programming languages.

As we have said, there are two large groups of programming languages, those with structured programming and those that are object oriented. In the first case the language consists of a set of instructions and orders as well as a set of rules of application thereof; propositional logic plays a fundamental role in this case and all operations can be subject to logical relationships. In the case of an object-oriented programming language, on the other hand, there is an intention to reflect in the language different circumstances of real existence; thus, reference will be made to objects, classes, inheritances, attributes, etc. Programming languages ​​can also be divided between interpreted languages ​​and compiled languages; in the first case the language must be interpreted by another program, while in the second case it must be translated by means of a compiler, creating in the process a file that is called executable.

The knowledge of some programming language can be very important to develop capacities in terms of problem solving and task automation. Certainly this type of knowledge coupled with some basic notions of algorithms can open a whole new panorama of job possibilities</p>
